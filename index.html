        <p>After a bunch of screwing around in my hosting account and eventually a call to the provider, I finally was able to get this blog deployed! It’s sort of bewildering that sometimes even the simplest tasks, in this case FTP, can become burdonsome and time consuming. I never really figured out why I had all the issues… I ended up just creating a brand new FTP user account and using that instead.</p>
<h3 id="Deploy-to-Web-Server-continued"><a href="#Deploy-to-Web-Server-continued" class="headerlink" title="Deploy to Web Server (continued)"></a>Deploy to Web Server (continued)</h3><p>Once I finally got the FTP thing squared away, I went back to VS Code to look at deploying the site using my liximomo SFTP plugin there. As I am really new to what I consider to be these new application file structures that are being generated by the tools I’m installing via NPM, it didn’t really occur to me that I’d have both source files and my generated public files that will go on the web server. Right now, my VS Code workspace is setup to via all my files initiated by Hexo, so using SFTP from here will not deploy to the correct file structure on my web server, and in the interest of what is becoming my mantra: avoiding rabbit holes, I decided to forgo the VS Code SFTP method, for now, and just push what I need to my server using a seperate tool–currently CyberDuck.</p>
<h3 id="Current-Process"><a href="#Current-Process" class="headerlink" title="Current Process"></a>Current Process</h3><p>I’m writing this out here to not only have a place to look this up for reference (probably tommorrow), but to possibly help push this into my brain a little better… maybe even remember it tomorrow ;)</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Navigate to the amen2that hexo directoy via the Terminal and type:</p>
<pre><code> hexo new &quot;Title For My Next Post&quot;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p> This will create a Markdown file in my source/_posts directoy, which I can access using VS Code and write to my heart’s content.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When I want to look at what I’m writing, I can run the blog in my localhost by running the following command:</p>
<pre><code> hexo server
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Once I am happy with my post and am ready to deploy it, I can do that by running <code>generate</code> command, which will compile my source files and generate my site in the /public/ directory. once I’ve don that, I’ll use <code>clean</code>, as it will clean the cache file (<code>db.json</code>) and <code>deploy</code> command, which will also push the public files to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amen2that.github.io/">amen2that.github.io</a></p>
<pre><code> hexo generate
 hexo clean &amp;&amp; deploy
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p> Lastly, I will want to push my public files located in my working hexo directory, ‘./amen2that/public/*‘ to my web server using whatever SFTP application I want… currently CyberDuck.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Don’t-Be-an-RSS-Hole"><a href="#Don’t-Be-an-RSS-Hole" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Be an RSS Hole"></a>Don’t Be an RSS Hole</h3><p>Now I can’t honestly say I’ve ever done much with RSS, either generating or consuming, but since this blog theme has a link to RSS that is currtly not doing anything, I’m seeing an opportunity to learn something new. It’s a rabbit hole, yes, but I’m going to keep this initial exploration rather limited. I want to simply install <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-generator-feed">the hexo-generator-feed plugin</a> in order to generate this XML content. I will worry about what to do with it later, but I just couldn’t live with a link to nowhere in the short term.</p>
<p>Well, I’m back from creating my RSS2and Atom feeds, both generated automatically after installing that plug-in, adding a few lines to my config file, then starting up the hexo server. Piece of cake! So now that I’m out of that hole, what’s next?</p>

        <p>So I’m still just getting warmed up with some of these new tools and am all thumbs. I recognize the criticality of getting familiarized with the blogging process and making sure that my content is being version controlled and published appropriately; however, I’m also trying to avoid getting wrested away from my defined focus with the many tangential rabbit holes littering my way on this journey.</p>
<h3 id="Github-Deployments"><a href="#Github-Deployments" class="headerlink" title="Github Deployments"></a>Github Deployments</h3><p>My first aim was to get the Hexo deployment process configured to post directly to my Github account. In planning for this, I became aware of something called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, which is probably not new, I’ve just become hopelessly out of touch with what’s going on in the modern development world. This is a free space for me to post a web page or site using my own Github account. Since I’ve typically viewed Github as a storage repository for verion control, I also figured I would want to deploy my Hexo source files there, while I would deploy my generated files in the Github Pages location. Also, since I have my own web hosting with a private domain name, I wanted to configure this process to deploy there, as well. From a quick review of the docs, it seems that I can do exactly what I want… piece of cake!</p>
<p>Well, in order to deploy both my generated files and my source files to Github Pages and a supporting repo, I need to use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions">Github Actions</a> to make this work. I took a stab at the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hexo.io/docs/github-pages">instructions found here</a> to get this working, but had issue right out of the gate. As I tried to read more about Github Actions, i started feeling like I was slipping into my first rabbit hole and decided, rather quickly, that maybe this is not a necessary route, for now.</p>
<h3 id="Hexo-Deployment-Plug-ins"><a href="#Hexo-Deployment-Plug-ins" class="headerlink" title="Hexo Deployment Plug-ins"></a>Hexo Deployment Plug-ins</h3><p>There is also an option for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hexo.io/docs/one-command-deployment">One-Command Deployments for Hexo</a> that has different plug-ins available to serve your needs. My first need is to get my stuff pushed to Github and for that, I can use a plug-in called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-deployer-git">hexo-deployer-git</a>. The only caveat with going this route is that it will only deploy my generated files to my Github Pages location, but not allow me to push the source to a standard repo. Although this is not my perfect world, I’m going to go ahead with this and just back up my source files manually using the standard git processes, which I need practice with anyway. I went ahead with the steps outlined and installed this plug-in, updated my _config.yml file with my Github details, then ran <code>hexo clean &amp;&amp; hexo deploy</code> to generate my site and push to my Github Page. After verifying with between Github and VS Code that this was what I wanted, my Hex Blog is live on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amen2that.github.io/">amen2that.github.io/</a>!</p>
<p>Now that I’ve gotten my content on my Github page, I think about how I didn’t even know what that was until this week and so clearly, it isn’t what I set out to do. What I really want is to get this blog posted on my private domain. Fortunately, there’s a plug-in for that too called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/lucascaro/hexo-deployer-sftp">hexo-deployer-sftp</a>. This, too, seems pretty straight forward, but I notice a warning on it’s github repo just warning you that it will delete everything off your server to match what you are deploying, which isn’t what i want to do. I figure I could test this and figure out how to make it work, but obviously my first step will be to back up what’s out there, thengo to work with tests… these fucking rabbits man!</p>
<p>I’m going to back up a second here… why do i need to deploy using Hexo? I can use VS Code to SFTP whatever files I want to my site really, really easily, using a process I’m already familiar with… SFTP!!! I mean… what the hell am I doing here. So the new steps are going to be to simply generate my pages using <code>hexo generate</code>, then just push them the old fashioned way from VS Code using SFTP. I mean… WTAF.</p>

        <p>It looks like I’ve finally gotten around to getting my blog launched. It seems that I’ve been this far before, but it’s really much harder to maintain and develop a blog vs. just getting it started. Hopefully, this time will be a charm.</p>
<h3 id="What’s-The-Plan"><a href="#What’s-The-Plan" class="headerlink" title="What’s The Plan?"></a>What’s The Plan?</h3><p>My plan will be to focus much more on documenting the things I’m learning to help me organize and better remember all these new things I discover and learn, and if I don’t rememeber it, which we know I won’t, I’ll have something here i can refer back to and jog my memory.</p>
<p>I know that there are many things on my list to learn, so my entries my be a bit disjointed in the topics that are being logged, at least initially, though my focus will be around front-end development, starting with HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript. It seems like I’ve been doing this stuff long enough that I would need to start there, but fundamentals are pretty critical and I know that there are some serious gaps in my knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="Stick-To-The-Plan"><a href="#Stick-To-The-Plan" class="headerlink" title="Stick To The Plan!"></a>Stick To The Plan!</h3><p>But even at this early onset of my new endeavor, I’m going to go off track and spend a little time on something else called <strong>Markdown</strong>, which is a document formatting mark-up of some kind that I’ve only very recently even heard of. I’ll be looking to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/">this handy guide on Markdown basic syntax</a> for starters. I’ll also be learning a bit about this blogging tool, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a>, which I just discovered today. I’m going with it due to its apparent simplicity and apparent hackability… hopefully my instinct is true on this choice! Lastly, I will (once again) be delving into <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> since Hexo is integrated into it by default and, frankly, I just really, really need to get my head out of my ass and learn this one.</p>
<p>OK, that’s all for now. Cheers!</p>
